#
# Runs inside the supervisor container (project mounted at /project, docker.sock mounted). Applies a VERIFIED
# update to the `server` + `caddy` services with a pre-update DB backup and AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK on any
# failure. Emits `PHASE <name>` / `ERR <msg>` / `OK <version>` lines on stdout — server.js parses these
# to drive /update/status. It NEVER touches `supervisor` or `postgres` (no self-destruct, no data loss).
#
# Sequence: backup → pull → recreate → healthcheck → done. A failed pull → rollback of .env only (no container
# changed yet). A later failure → rollback (restore versions, stop the server, restore the DB, recreate the old
# images, re-health-check) → rolled_back, or failed (non-zero, with ERR lines saying what state it is in) if the
# rollback itself can't recover.
#
# supervisor/test.js drives it with a stub docker (order, exit codes, messages). The restore was checked by hand
# against postgres:14 with a good and a deliberately broken dump; validate the full path on a staging deploy.
set -uo pipefail   # deliberately NOT -e: failures are handled explicitly so we can roll back.
# Everything these scripts create is private: the DB dump holds password hashes, and the .env snapshot, the pointer
# and restore.log sit beside it. (The host .env is only rewritten in place: sed -i and >> keep its mode and owner.)

# --- restore_db <dump> <log>: put the database back to the pre-update dump. Returns non-zero after ERR lines. ---
# The dump is plain SQL from `pg_dump --clean --if-exists`: it drops and recreates every object. So:
#  1. the server is STOPPED first: it holds pooled connections whose locks would block (or race) the drops, and
#     whatever runs next must not see a half-restored schema. caddy keeps running, so /recovery stays up;
#  2. ONE psql session, ONE transaction (--single-transaction wraps the -c's and the -f in a single BEGIN/COMMIT, in
#     order): first a bounded lock_timeout, then every other session on the database is ended (a stray client or a
#     stuck backend holding a lock), then the dump. Same session, so no gap for a new lock to slip in between;
#  3. the bound holds for the whole dump: its preamble says `SET lock_timeout = 0;`, which would cancel an earlier SET,
#     so that one line (the preamble's, never data) is rewritten on the way in. A lock that cannot be ended (e.g. a prepared transaction) is then a loud
#     "lock timeout" failure instead of a restore that hangs forever;
#  4. -o /dev/null: result rows (the dump's setval()s) are dropped, so restore.log holds only notices (the number of
#     sessions ended) and errors;
#  5. ON_ERROR_STOP=1: any error aborts the transaction with a non-zero exit and the database is left exactly as it
#     was (without it, psql exits 0 on SQL errors and a failed restore went unreported).
# The caller switches .env to the backup's versions only AFTER this succeeds, so on any failure .env still names the
# version the database belongs to (a later `docker compose up` never pairs old images with the new database). On a
# failed restore the server is left stopped on purpose. The operator retries Roll back (same backup) once the cause is
# fixed; DEPLOY.md has the by-hand restore.
