# rollback.sh — restore the most recent pre-update backup (the .env version snapshot + DB dump that
# apply.sh wrote): stop `server`, restore the DB, recreate `server` + `caddy` on the old versions, health-check.
# The break-glass recovery action. Emits PHASE/ERR/OK lines for server.js, mirroring apply.sh, and exits non-zero on
# any failure. Never touches `supervisor` or `postgres` containers. Data written since the update is discarded.

# --- restore_db <dump> <log>: put the database back to the pre-update dump. Returns non-zero after ERR lines. ---
# The dump is plain SQL from `pg_dump --clean --if-exists`: it drops and recreates every object. So:
#  1. the server is STOPPED first: it holds pooled connections whose locks would block (or race) the drops, and
#     whatever runs next must not see a half-restored schema. caddy keeps running, so /recovery stays up;
#  2. ONE psql session, ONE transaction (--single-transaction wraps the -c's and the -f in a single BEGIN/COMMIT, in
#     order): first a bounded lock_timeout, then every other session on the database is ended (a stray client or a
#     stuck backend holding a lock), then the dump. Same session, so no gap for a new lock to slip in between;
#  3. the bound holds for the whole dump: its preamble says `SET lock_timeout = 0;`, which would cancel an earlier SET,
#     so that line is rewritten on the way in. A lock that cannot be ended (e.g. a prepared transaction) is then a loud
#     "lock timeout" failure instead of a restore that hangs forever;
#  4. ON_ERROR_STOP=1: any error aborts the transaction with a non-zero exit and the database is left exactly as it
#     was (without it, psql exits 0 on SQL errors and a failed restore went unreported).
# The caller switches .env to the backup's versions only AFTER this succeeds, so on any failure .env still names the
# version the database belongs to (a later `docker compose up` never pairs old images with the new database). On a
# failed restore the server is left stopped on purpose. The operator retries Roll back (same backup) once the cause is
# fixed; DEPLOY.md has the by-hand restore.
